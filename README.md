## Summary of Criteria

Assignment was to create a weather application that will:

* use OneWeatherMap API to create a weather dashboard that provides results to user search using form inputs 

* use fetch to get weather information response.

* include city name, date, weather icon, temperature, wind speed and UV index in results

* provide 5 day weather forecast for location.

* create buttons for history searches that user can use to call results again.

## Summary of Experience

- The successes of my efforts were getting the dashboard to fetch the API information successfully from the user input and display different information based on multiple fetch responses, including using Moment as an additional API. I was also able to successfully write most of the html using javascript, jquery and template literals. 

- Problems I experienced included many - most of this assignment took me a long time to get to work. I also was unable to finish the part where the 5 day forecast would replace with each search. I will need to fix that.
